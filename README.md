# Encoder Decoder game
I made this game last year in a introductory programming course at my school. I used python to create this game called EncoderDecoder.

A group of friends can use this to have secret conversations- all they need to have is a common number key which will allow them to encode and then only a person with the number key can decode a message.

In the future, I will try to implement this into a gui to make it much more user friendly.

Any comments or suggestions are appreicated !
